NY property fraud analysis report


# Executive Summary

This report examines the 2010-2011 New York property dataset, which contains over a million property records in New York City and highlights abnormalities and potential fraud events in the dataset. To solve this project, our team focused on first understanding the nature of real estate fraud inherent in this dataset. According to US Legal, Inc, real estate fraud takes many forms, including common schemes such as foreclosure bailout, home equity fraud, mortgage fraud, and deceptive timeshare scams.

We then explored the dataset through a Data Quality Report (DQR), optimized the overall modeling structure, and gleaned insights from the results of the analysis. We adopted analysis methods including Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Heuristic Algorithm, and Autoencoder, and conducted all data analysis and manipulation using Python and Jupyter Notebook.
Major components of the analysis include:

1. Data cleaning and filling in missing fields
2. Designing and building new variables
3. Dimensionality reduction through PCA process
4. Calculating and comparing fraud score using heuristic algorithm and autoencoder methods

We selected a total of ten unique, abnormal records with highest fraud scores, using both Heuristic Algorithm and Autoencoder, and classified them as potential fraud occurrences. Through further investigation, we explained why these ten records have extremely high fraud scores.
Our explanations for these latent fraud records include:

1. Incorrect data inputs
2. Mortgage fraud
3. Tax avoidance
